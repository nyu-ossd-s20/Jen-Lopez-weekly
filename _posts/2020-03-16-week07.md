title: Week 7 - Learning Git and Final Projects
---

One of my goals for this class is to learn more about Git version control. Although I know Git basics (e.g. add, commits, pull requests), I don't understand why they worked the way they did and why I always got weird "HEAD" comments on my files when a merge conflict arises. This week, our lecture was dedicated to helping us understand git version control, enough to prepare us for our final project contributions.
